### Idea at glance

We aim to revolutionise the farming sector by introducing an investment-token based model which will help farmers in raising capital against their land and production output value. We aim to create a decetralized echo-system for agriculture. 

### Current challenges:

Farmers find it difficult to raise capital for investing money and resources in there land for growing new crop. For that they have to give there land papers as security against loan to zamindars.
High interest rates and inability to repay loan after crop failure is the biggest issue. 
Small scale industries and startups find it hard to invest and buy raw goods

This model will act as exchange between investors and farmers with both parties at advantage.

### Model Characteristics: 

Our system will link users (investors) directly with farmers. Farmers can ask for funds in exchange of some percent of revenue generated in the crop production by farmer.

This network will be implemented on a blockchain system, where transactions and smart contracts will take place between user and farmer.  Tokens will be generated which will contain virtual land area and amount of investment and expected profit. And these 3 parameters will collectively decide the value of the token.

Users can buy and sell these tokens depending upon supply and demand.
