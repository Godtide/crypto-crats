### Idea at glance

We aim to revolutionise the farming sector by introducing an investment-token based model which will help farmers in raising capital against their land and production output value. We aim to create a decentralised eco-system for agriculture.

### Current challenges:

* Farmers find it difficult to raise capital for investing money and resources in there land for growing new crop. 
* For that they have to give there land papers as security against loan to zamindars.
* High interest rates and inability to repay loan after crop failure is the biggest issue. 
* Small scale industries and startups find it hard to invest and buy raw goods


**Our model will act as exchange between investors and farmers with both parties at advantage.**

### Model Characteristics: 

Our system will link users (investors) directly with farmers. Farmers can ask for funds in exchange of some percent of revenue generated in the crop production by farmer.

This network will be implemented on a blockchain system, where transactions and smart contracts will take place between user and farmer. Tokens will be generated which will contain amount of investment required and expected revenue.

Users/Investors can buy and sell these tokens depending upon supply and demand.

### Future Goals
* Integrate Decentralized Insurance mechanism to assure the farmer about the uncertainity of crop failure.
* Make it reach vast community of farmers using all the available mediums (Mobile app, SMS)
* Harness the power of IoT to validate and automate most of the processes.
* Using RNN (Reccurent Neural Network) to assist investor as well as farmers to predict various fluctuations in crop productions and crop profit, (This can be implemented using Community Chat Bots, (SMS, Zulip))
